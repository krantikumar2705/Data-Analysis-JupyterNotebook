# Ecommerce Clients Linear Regression Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to help a company make a data-driven decision on whether to focus their efforts on improving their mobile app experience or their website. We will analyze customer data to understand the relationship between various factors and the amount of money spent by customers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and contains information about customers of an e-commerce website. The dataset includes the following features:

- Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
- Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes.
- Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes.
- Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member. (Note: All personal information is not real.)

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Involved
1. Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and explore its structure, look for missing values, and get basic statistics.
2. Data Visualization: Visualize the data to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable.
3. Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for training by handling missing values, scaling features if necessary, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training: Train a linear regression model on the training data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics.
6. Interpretation: Interpret the results and provide recommendations based on the model.
