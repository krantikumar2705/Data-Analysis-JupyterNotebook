# Credit Card Fraud Detection

The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## Main Challenges in Credit Card Fraud Detection

1. **Enormous Data**: Enormous data is processed every day and the model built must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.
2. **Imbalanced Data**: Most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent, making it really hard to detect the fraudulent ones.
3. **Data Availability**: The data is mostly private.
4. **Misclassified Data**: Not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported, which can be another major issue.
5. **Adaptive Techniques by Scammers**: Scammers may use adaptive techniques against the model.

## Tackling These Challenges

1. **Model Simplicity and Speed**: The model must be simple and fast enough to detect anomalies and classify them as fraudulent transactions as quickly as possible.
2. **Handling Imbalance**: Imbalance can be dealt with by properly using some methods, which will be discussed in the next paragraph.
3. **Protecting Privacy**: To protect the privacy of the user, the dimensionality of the data can be reduced.
4. **Trustworthy Data Sources**: A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-checks the data, at least for training the model.
5. **Model Interpretability**: Making the model simple and interpretable ensures that when scammers adapt to it, with just some tweaks, we can have a new model up and running to deploy.
